# Real Time Multiple Object Tracking uisng YOLOv4, Tensorflow and DeepSORT
YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once version 4) is a real-time object detection algorithm. TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework, and DeepSort is a real-time multi-object tracking algorithm.You would use TensorFlow to implement the YOLOv4 model and run it on a video stream to detect the objects in real-time. Finally, you would use the DeepSort algorithm to track the detected objects over time by matching their detections across frames and estimating their positions.
